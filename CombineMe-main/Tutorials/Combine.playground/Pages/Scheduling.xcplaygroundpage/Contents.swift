 From: https://www.vadimbulavin.com/understanding-schedulers-in-swift-combine-framework/
 
 Letâ€™s summarize the key points to remember:

 * subscribe(on:) and receive(on:) are primary multithreading methods of Combine Swift framework.
 
 * The default scheduler uses the same thread from where the element was generated.
 
 * receive(on:) sets a scheduler for all operators coming afterwards.
  
 * subscribe(on:) sets a scheduler for the whole stream, starting at the time the Publisher is subscribed to. The stream stays on the same scheduler, until receive(on:) specifies another scheduler.
 
 * The position of subscribe(on:) does not matter.
 
 * Asynchronous work is typically performed by subscribing on the background scheduler and receiving values on the UI scheduler.
